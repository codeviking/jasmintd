# jasmintd

Adapter enabling the execution of [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) based unit tests using [JsTestDriver](http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/) and [requirejs](http://requirejs.org/). 

If you're interested in using this adapter, I'd suggest taking a look (or starting with) the [jasmintd-scaffold](https://github.com/codeviking/jasmintd-scaffold).
